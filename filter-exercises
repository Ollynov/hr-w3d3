Basic Requirements

Use filter to write the following functions:

Write a function called evens that takes an array of numbers as a parameter, and returns an array of only the even numbers in the parameter.

Write a function called multiplesOfThree that takes an array of numbers as a parameter, and returns an array of only the numbers that are multiples of three.

Write a function called positives that takes an array of numbers as a parameter, and returns an array of only the numbers that are positive.

Write a function called evenLength that takes an array of strings and returns an array of only the strings with an even length.
